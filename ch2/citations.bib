abstract = {In this study, data from dry temperate grassland vegetation in Denmark are used to compare the predictive power of gradients obtained by ordination. One of the problems of ordination methods based on weighted averag- ing, namely the assumption of symmetric, unimodal re- sponse curves, is investigated by smoothing species re- sponses to simple and complex gradients respectively. It was found that species response types to a pH gradient are diverse and often deviate from a unimodal, symmetrical shape. Bimodal responses were also found, but they disap- peared when more influential gradients were considered. Many species showed truncated responses with optima near gradient ends. In order to assess the impact of unrealistic response as- sumptions and reported problems with instability on the per- formance of DCA, the predictive potentials of measured vari- ables and coenoclines extracted by DCA were compared. Despite field data violating the assumption of unimodal re- sponse, DCA was found to extract gradients predicting species abundance better than the environmental variables available. Shortcomings and advantages of indirect and direct methods in plant ecology are discussed.},

abstract = {Predicting the future climate and its impacts on the global environment is model based, presenting a level of uncertainty. Alternative robust approaches of analyzing high volume climate data to reveal underlying regional and local trends are increasingly incorporating satellite data. This study uses a centered log-ratio (clr) transformation approach and robust principal component analysis (PCA), on a long-term Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) dataset to test its applicability in analyzing large $\backslash$r$\backslash$nmulti-temporal data, and potential to recognize important trends and patterns in regional climate. Twenty five years of NDVI data derived by Global Inventory Modeling and Mapping Studies (GIMMS) from 1982 to 2006 were extracted for 88 subwatersheds in central Kenya and statistically analyzed. Untransformed (raw) and clr transformed NDVI data were evaluated using robust PCA. The robust PCA compositional biplots of the clr transformed long-term NDVI data demonstrated the finest spatial-temporal display of observations identifying climate related events that impacted vegetation activity and observed variations in greenness. The responses were interpreted as normal conditions, El Ni{\~{n}}o Southern Oscillation (ENSO) events of El Ni{\~{n}}o and La Ni{\~{n}}a, and drought events known to influence the moisture level and precipitation patterns (high, low, normal) and therefore the level of vegetation greenness (NDVI value). More drought events (4) were observed between 1990 and 2006, a finding corroborated by several authors and linked to increasing climate variability. Results are remarkable, emphasizing the need for appropriate data transformation prior to PCA, dealing with huge complex datasets, to enhance pattern recognition and meaningful interpretation of results. Through improved analysis of past data, uncertainty is decreased in modeling future trends.},

@article{Kenkel2006,
abstract = {The broad objective of multivariate data analysis in biology is to summarize associations among species (the dependent or response variables), and to elu- cidate species responses to one or more environmental factors (the independent or predictor variables). This objective is achieved by reducing the dimensionality of variable space to an efficient, low-dimensional summative model of the underlying data struc- ture that reflects the coordinated response of species to environmental factors. While multivariate methods have proven indis- pensable for analyzing both experimental and survey data in the biological sciences, considerable confusion persists regarding the selection of appropriate analytical strategies. The selection of an appropriate analytical strategy, which includes important deci- sions regarding data transformation, variable standardization and methodological approach, should be based on fundamental con- siderations of statistical appropriateness, data structure, and study objectives. Unfortunately, past and more recent assessments of multivariate analytical strategies have been based largely on empirical models of questionable relevance. This empirical approach has led to misleading recommendations and erroneous generalizations regarding the relative efficacy of the available multivariate methods. This paper dispels these misleading recommendations and provides some general guidelines for selecting appropriate data transformations, variable standardizations and methodological approaches in the multivariate analysis of biological data.},

abstract = {This work contains a theoretical study and computer simulations of a new self-organizing process. The principal discovery is that in a simple network of adaptive physical elements which receives signals from a primary event space, the signal representations are automatically mapped onto a set of output responses in such a way that the responses acquire the same topological order as that of the primary events. In other words, a principle has been discovered which facilitates the automatic formation of topologically correct maps of features of observable events. The basic self-organizing system is a one- or two-dimensional array of processing units resembling a network of threshold-logic units, and characterized by short-range lateral feedback between neighbouring units. Several types of computer simulations are used to demonstrate the ordering process as well as the conditions under which it fails.},

However, insight into microbial community composition is limited by our ability to detect patterns in this flood of sequences. Here we compare the performance of 51 analysis techniques using real and simulated bacterial 16S rRNA pyrosequencing datasets containing either clustered samples or samples arrayed across environmental gradients. We found that many diversity patterns were evident with severely undersampled communities and that methods varied widely in their ability to detect gradients and clusters. Chi-squared distances and Pearson correlation distances performed especially well for detecting gradients, whereas Gower and Canberra distances performed especially well for detecting clusters. These results also provide a basis for understanding tradeoffs between number of samples and depth of coverage, tradeoffs that are important to consider when designing studies to characterize microbial communities.},

abstract = {We introduce here a new method for computing differences between microbial communities based on phylogenetic information. This method, UniFrac, measures the phylogenetic distance between sets of taxa in a phylogenetic tree as the fraction of the branch length of the tree that leads to descendants from either one environment or the other, but not both. UniFrac can be used to determine whether communities are signifi- cantly different, to compare many communities simultaneously using clustering and ordination techniques, and to measure the relative contributions of different factors, such as chemistry and geography, to similarities between samples. We demonstrate the utility of UniFrac by applying it to published 16S rRNA gene libraries from cultured isolates and environmental clones of bacteria in marine sediment, water, and ice. Our results reveal that (i) cultured isolates from ice, water, and sediment resemble each other and environmental clone sequences from sea ice, but not environmental clone sequences from sediment and water; (ii) the geographical location does not correlate strongly with bacterial community differences in ice and sediment from the Arctic and Antarctic; and (iii) bacterial communities differ between terrestrially impacted seawater (whether polar or temperate) and warm oligotrophic seawater, whereas those in individual seawater samples are not more similar to each other than to those in sediment or ice samples. These results illustrate that UniFrac provides a new way of characterizing microbial communities, using the wealth of environmental rRNA sequences, and allows quantitative insight into the factors that underlie the distribution of lineages among environments.},

We show that it is a metric (unlike the original EMD [1] which is a metric only for normalized histograms). Moreover, it is a natural extension of the L 1 metric. Second, we propose a linear time algorithm for the computation of the EMD variant, with a robust ground distance for oriented gradients. Finally, extensive experimental results on the Mikolajczyk and Schmid dataset [2] show that our method outperforms state of the art distances.},

In such cases, the development of both a suitable heuristics and a good measure for guiding the search are essential for discovering interesting biclusters in an expression matrix. Nevertheless, not all existing biclustering approaches base their search on evaluation measures for biclusters. There exists a diverse set of biclustering tools that follow different strategies and algorithmic concepts which guide the search towards meaningful results. In this paper we present a extensive survey of biclustering approaches, classifying them into two categories according to whether or not use evaluation metrics within the search method: biclustering algorithms based on evaluation measures and non metric-based biclustering algorithms. In both cases, they have been classified according to the type of meta-heuristics which they are based on.},

abstract = {The rate of evolution of macromolecules such as ribosomal RNAs and proteins varies along the molecule because structural and functional constraints differ between sites. Many studies have shown that ignoring this variation in computing evolutionary distances leads to severe underestimation of sequence divergences, and thus can lead to misleading evolutionary tree inferences. We propose here a new parsimony-based method for computing evolutionary distances between pairs of sequences that takes into account this variation and estimates it from the data. This method applies to the number of substitutions per site in ribosomal RNA genes as well as to the number of nonsynonymous substitutions per codon for protein-coding genes and is especially suitable when large data sets ({\textgreater} or = 100 sequences) are analyzed. First, starting from a phylogeny constructed with usual distances, the maximum-parsimony method is used to infer the distribution of the number of substitutions that have occurred at each site (or codon) along this tree. This distribution is then fitted to an "invariant + truncated negative binomial" distribution that allows for invariant sites. Maximum-likelihood fitting of this distribution to different data sets showed that it agreed very well with real data. Noticeably, allowing for invariant sites seemed to be very important. Finally, two distance estimates were developed by introducing the distribution of site variability into the substitution models of Jukes and Cantor and of Kimura. The use of different numbers of aligned sequences (up to 1,000 rRNA sequences) showed that the parameters of the model are very sensitive to the number of sequences used to estimate them. However, if at least 100 sequences are considered, the two new distance estimates are quite stable with respect to the number of sequences used to fit the distribution. This stability is true for low as well as for high evolutionary distances. These new distances appeared to be much better estimates of the number of substitutions per site than the classical distances of Jukes and Cantor and of Kimura, which both greatly underestimate this number, so that they can serve as indexes to detect saturation. We conclude that the new distances are particularly suitable for phylogenetic analysis when very distantly related species and relatively large data sets are considered. Trees reconstructed using these distances are generally different from those constructed by means of the classical estimates. Using this new method, we showed that the mean evolutionary distance between Prokaryotes and Eukaryotes is substantially higher for the small-subunit than for the large-subunit rRNAs. This suggests than the former might have experienced a drastic change during the early evolution of Eukaryotes.},
