	abstract = {In this study, data from dry temperate grassland vegetation in Denmark are used to compare the predictive power of gradients obtained by ordination. One of the problems of ordination methods based on weighted averag- ing, namely the assumption of symmetric, unimodal re- sponse curves, is investigated by smoothing species re- sponses to simple and complex gradients respectively. It was found that species response types to a pH gradient are diverse and often deviate from a unimodal, symmetrical shape. Bimodal responses were also found, but they disap- peared when more influential gradients were considered. Many species showed truncated responses with optima near gradient ends. In order to assess the impact of unrealistic response as- sumptions and reported problems with instability on the per- formance of DCA, the predictive potentials of measured vari- ables and coenoclines extracted by DCA were compared. Despite field data violating the assumption of unimodal re- sponse, DCA was found to extract gradients predicting species abundance better than the environmental variables available. Shortcomings and advantages of indirect and direct methods in plant ecology are discussed.},

This study uses a centered log-ratio (clr) transformation approach and robust principal component analysis (PCA), on a long-term Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) dataset to test its applicability in analyzing large $\backslash$r$\backslash$nmulti-temporal data, and potential to recognize important trends and patterns in regional climate. Twenty five years of NDVI data derived by Global Inventory Modeling and Mapping Studies (GIMMS) from 1982 to 2006 were extracted for 88 subwatersheds in central Kenya and statistically analyzed. Untransformed (raw) and clr transformed NDVI data were evaluated using robust PCA. The robust PCA compositional biplots of the clr transformed long-term NDVI data demonstrated the finest spatial-temporal display of observations identifying climate related events that impacted vegetation activity and observed variations in greenness. The responses were interpreted as normal conditions, El Ni{\~{n}}o Southern Oscillation (ENSO) events of El Ni{\~{n}}o and La Ni{\~{n}}a, and drought events known to influence the moisture level and precipitation patterns (high, low, normal) and therefore the level of vegetation greenness (NDVI value). More drought events (4) were observed between 1990 and 2006, a finding corroborated by several authors and linked to increasing climate variability. Results are remarkable, emphasizing the need for appropriate data transformation prior to PCA, dealing with huge complex datasets, to enhance pattern recognition and meaningful interpretation of results. Through improved analysis of past data, uncertainty is decreased in modeling future trends.},

	abstract = {The broad objective of multivariate data analysis in biology is to summarize associations among species (the dependent or response variables), and to elu- cidate species responses to one or more environmental factors (the independent or predictor variables). This objective is achieved by reducing the dimensionality of variable space to an efficient, low-dimensional summative model of the underlying data struc- ture that reflects the coordinated response of species to environmental factors. While multivariate methods have proven indis- pensable for analyzing both experimental and survey data in the biological sciences, considerable confusion persists regarding the selection of appropriate analytical strategies. The selection of an appropriate analytical strategy, which includes important deci- sions regarding data transformation, variable standardization and methodological approach, should be based on fundamental con- siderations of statistical appropriateness, data structure, and study objectives. Unfortunately, past and more recent assessments of multivariate analytical strategies have been based largely on empirical models of questionable relevance. This empirical approach has led to misleading recommendations and erroneous generalizations regarding the relative efficacy of the available multivariate methods. This paper dispels these misleading recommendations and provides some general guidelines for selecting appropriate data transformations, variable standardizations and methodological approaches in the multivariate analysis of biological data.},

The principal discovery is that in a simple network of adaptive physical elements which receives signals from a primary event space, the signal representations are automatically mapped onto a set of output responses in such a way that the responses acquire the same topological order as that of the primary events. In other words, a principle has been discovered which facilitates the automatic formation of topologically correct maps of features of observable events. The basic self-organizing system is a one- or two-dimensional array of processing units resembling a network of threshold-logic units, and characterized by short-range lateral feedback between neighbouring units. Several types of computer simulations are used to demonstrate the ordering process as well as the conditions under which it fails.},

Chi-squared distances and Pearson correlation distances performed especially well for detecting gradients, whereas Gower and Canberra distances performed especially well for detecting clusters. These results also provide a basis for understanding tradeoffs between number of samples and depth of coverage, tradeoffs that are important to consider when designing studies to characterize microbial communities.},

This method, UniFrac, measures the phylogenetic distance between sets of taxa in a phylogenetic tree as the fraction of the branch length of the tree that leads to descendants from either one environment or the other, but not both. UniFrac can be used to determine whether communities are signifi- cantly different, to compare many communities simultaneously using clustering and ordination techniques, and to measure the relative contributions of different factors, such as chemistry and geography, to similarities between samples. We demonstrate the utility of UniFrac by applying it to published 16S rRNA gene libraries from cultured isolates and environmental clones of bacteria in marine sediment, water, and ice. Our results reveal that (i) cultured isolates from ice, water, and sediment resemble each other and environmental clone sequences from sea ice, but not environmental clone sequences from sediment and water; (ii) the geographical location does not correlate strongly with bacterial community differences in ice and sediment from the Arctic and Antarctic; and (iii) bacterial communities differ between terrestrially impacted seawater (whether polar or temperate) and warm oligotrophic seawater, whereas those in individual seawater samples are not more similar to each other than to those in sediment or ice samples. These results illustrate that UniFrac provides a new way of characterizing microbial communities, using the wealth of environmental rRNA sequences, and allows quantitative insight into the factors that underlie the distribution of lineages among environments.},

We show that it is a metric (unlike the original EMD [1] which is a metric only for normalized histograms). Moreover, it is a natural extension of the L 1 metric. Second, we propose a linear time algorithm for the computation of the EMD variant, with a robust ground distance for oriented gradients. Finally, extensive experimental results on the Mikolajczyk and Schmid dataset [2] show that our method outperforms state of the art distances.},

In such cases, the development of both a suitable heuristics and a good measure for guiding the search are essential for discovering interesting biclusters in an expression matrix. Nevertheless, not all existing biclustering approaches base their search on evaluation measures for biclusters. There exists a diverse set of biclustering tools that follow different strategies and algorithmic concepts which guide the search towards meaningful results. In this paper we present a extensive survey of biclustering approaches, classifying them into two categories according to whether or not use evaluation metrics within the search method: biclustering algorithms based on evaluation measures and non metric-based biclustering algorithms. In both cases, they have been classified according to the type of meta-heuristics which they are based on.},

	abstract = {The rate of evolution of macromolecules such as ribosomal RNAs and proteins varies along the molecule because structural and functional constraints differ between sites. Many studies have shown that ignoring this variation in computing evolutionary distances leads to severe underestimation of sequence divergences, and thus can lead to misleading evolutionary tree inferences. We propose here a new parsimony-based method for computing evolutionary distances between pairs of sequences that takes into account this variation and estimates it from the data. This method applies to the number of substitutions per site in ribosomal RNA genes as well as to the number of nonsynonymous substitutions per codon for protein-coding genes and is especially suitable when large data sets ({\textgreater} or = 100 sequences) are analyzed. First, starting from a phylogeny constructed with usual distances, the maximum-parsimony method is used to infer the distribution of the number of substitutions that have occurred at each site (or codon) along this tree. This distribution is then fitted to an "invariant + truncated negative binomial" distribution that allows for invariant sites. Maximum-likelihood fitting of this distribution to different data sets showed that it agreed very well with real data. Noticeably, allowing for invariant sites seemed to be very important. Finally, two distance estimates were developed by introducing the distribution of site variability into the substitution models of Jukes and Cantor and of Kimura. The use of different numbers of aligned sequences (up to 1,000 rRNA sequences) showed that the parameters of the model are very sensitive to the number of sequences used to estimate them. However, if at least 100 sequences are considered, the two new distance estimates are quite stable with respect to the number of sequences used to fit the distribution. This stability is true for low as well as for high evolutionary distances. These new distances appeared to be much better estimates of the number of substitutions per site than the classical distances of Jukes and Cantor and of Kimura, which both greatly underestimate this number, so that they can serve as indexes to detect saturation. We conclude that the new distances are particularly suitable for phylogenetic analysis when very distantly related species and relatively large data sets are considered. Trees reconstructed using these distances are generally different from those constructed by means of the classical estimates. Using this new method, we showed that the mean evolutionary distance between Prokaryotes and Eukaryotes is substantially higher for the small-subunit than for the large-subunit rRNAs. This suggests than the former might have experienced a drastic change during the early evolution of Eukaryotes.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Understanding the normal temporal variation in the human microbiome is critical to developing treatments for putative microbiome-related afflictions such as obesity, Crohn's disease, inflammatory bowel disease and malnutrition. Sequencing and computational technologies, however, have been a limiting factor in performing dense time series analysis of the human microbiome. Here, we present the largest human microbiota time series analysis to date, covering two individuals at four body sites over 396 timepoints.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: We find that despite stable differences between body sites and individuals, there is pronounced variability in an individual's microbiota across months, weeks and even days. Additionally, only a small fraction of the total taxa found within a single body site appear to be present across all time points, suggesting that no core temporal microbiome exists at high abundance (although some microbes may be present but drop below the detection threshold). Many more taxa appear to be persistent but non-permanent community members.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: DNA sequencing and computational advances described here provide the ability to go beyond infrequent snapshots of our human-associated microbial ecology to high-resolution assessments of temporal variations over protracted periods, within and between body habitats and individuals. This capacity will allow us to define normal variation and pathologic states, and assess responses to therapeutic interventions.},

Yet, we lack a comprehensive understanding of how lifestyle affects the dynamics of human-associated microbial communities.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: Here, we link over 10,000 longitudinal measurements of human wellness and action to the daily gut and salivary microbiota dynamics of two individuals over the course of one year. These time series show overall microbial communities to be stable for months. However, rare events in each subjects' life rapidly and broadly impacted microbiota dynamics. Travel from the developed to the developing world in one subject led to a nearly two-fold increase in the Bacteroidetes to Firmicutes ratio, which reversed upon return. Enteric infection in the other subject resulted in the permanent decline of most gut bacterial taxa, which were replaced by genetically similar species. Still, even during periods of overall community stability, the dynamics of select microbial taxa could be associated with specific host behaviors. Most prominently, changes in host fiber intake positively correlated with next-day abundance changes among 15{\%} of gut microbiota members.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that although human-associated microbial communities are generally stable, they can be quickly and profoundly altered by common human actions and experiences.},

An improved algorithm (Anderberg 1973), while still requiring 0( n 3 ) worst-case time, can reasonably be expected to exhibit 0( n 2 ) expected behavior. By contrast, we describe a SAHN clustering algorithm that requires 0( n 2 log n ) time in the worst case. When SAHN clustering methods exhibit reasonable space distortion properties, further improvements are possible. We adapt a SAHN clustering algorithm, based on the efficient construction of nearest neighbor chains, to obtain a reasonably general SAHN clustering algorithm that requires in the worst case 0( n 2 ) time and space.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Fungal endophyte communities are often comprised of many species colonizing the same host. However, little is known about the causes of this diversity. On the one hand, the apparent coexistence of closely related species may be explained by the traditional niche differentiation hypothesis, which suggests that abiotic and/or biotic factors mediate partitioning. For endophytes, such factors are difficult to identify, and are therefore in most cases unknown. On the other hand, there is the neutral hypothesis, which suggests that stochastic factors may explain high species diversity. There is a need to investigate to what extent each of these hypotheses may apply to endophytes.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: The niche partitioning of two closely related fungal endophytes, Microdochium bolleyi and M. phragmitis, colonizing Phragmites australis, was investigated. The occurrences of each species were assessed using specific nested-PCR assays for 251 field samples of common reed from Lake Constance, Germany. These analyses revealed niche preferences for both fungi. From three niche factors assessed, i.e. host habitat, host organ and season, host habitat significantly differentiated the two species. M. bolleyi preferred dry habitats, whereas M. phragmitis prevailed in flooded habitats. In contrast, both species exhibited a significant preference for the same host organ, i.e. roots. Likewise the third factor, season, did not significantly distinguish the two species. Differences in carbon utilization and growth temperature could not conclusively explain the niches. The inclusion of three unrelated species of Ascomycota, which also colonize P. australis at the same locations, indicated spatio-temporal niche partitioning between all fungi. None of the species exhibited the same preferences for all three factors, i.e. host habitat, host organ, and time of the season.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: The fungal species colonizing common reed investigated in this study seem to exploit niche differences leading to a separation in space and time, which may allow for their coexistence on the same host. A purely neutral model is unlikely to explain the coexistence of closely related endophytes on common reed.},

	abstract = {Purpose: The ability to properly analyze and interpret large microbiome data sets has lagged behind our ability to acquire such data sets from environmental or clinical samples. Sequencing instruments impose a structure on these data: the natural sample space of a 16S rRNA gene sequencing data set is a simplex, which is a part of real space that is restricted to nonnegative values with a constant sum. Such data are compositional and should be analyzed using compositionally appropriate tools and approaches. However, most of the tools for 16S rRNA gene sequencing analysis assume these data are unrestricted. Methods: We show that existing tools for compositional data (CoDa) analysis can be readily adapted to analyze high-throughput sequencing data sets. Results: The Human Microbiome Project tongue versus buccal mucosa data set shows how the CoDa approach can address the major elements of microbiome analysis. Reanalysis of a publicly available autism microbiome data set shows that the CoDa approach in concert with multiple hypothesis test corrections prevent false positive identifications. Conclusions: The CoDa approach is readily scalable to microbiome-sized analyses. We provide example code and make recommendations to improve the analysis and reporting of microbiome data sets.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: The currently accepted thesis on nitrogenous fertilizer additions on methane oxidation activity assumes niche partitioning among methanotrophic species, with activity responses to changes in nitrogen content being dependent on the in situ methanotrophic community structure Unfortunately, widely applied tools for microbial community assessment only have a limited phylogenetic resolution mostly restricted to genus level diversity, and not to species level as often mistakenly assumed. As a consequence, intragenus or intraspecies metabolic versatility in nitrogen metabolism was never evaluated nor considered among methanotrophic bacteria as a source of differential responses of methane oxidation to nitrogen amendments.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: We demonstrated that fourteen genotypically different Methylomonas strains, thus distinct below the level at which most techniques assign operational taxonomic units (OTU), show a versatile physiology in their nitrogen metabolism. Differential responses, even among strains with identical 16S rRNA or pmoA gene sequences, were observed for production of nitrite and nitrous oxide from nitrate or ammonium, nitrogen fixation and tolerance to high levels of ammonium, nitrate, and hydroxylamine. Overall, reduction of nitrate to nitrite, nitrogen fixation, higher tolerance to ammonium than nitrate and tolerance and assimilation of nitrite were general features.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: Differential responses among closely related methanotrophic strains to overcome inhibition and toxicity from high nitrogen loads and assimilation of various nitrogen sources yield competitive fitness advantages to individual methane-oxidizing bacteria. Our observations proved that community structure at the deepest phylogenetic resolution potentially influences in situ functioning.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Many bioinformatics analyses, ranging from gene clustering to phylogenetics, produce hierarchical trees as their main result. These are used to represent the relationships among different biological entities, thus facilitating their analysis and interpretation. A number of standalone programs are available that focus on tree visualization or that perform specific analyses on them. However, such applications are rarely suitable for large-scale surveys, in which a higher level of automation is required. Currently, many genome-wide analyses rely on tree-like data representation and hence there is a growing need for scalable tools to handle tree structures at large scale.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: Here we present the Environment for Tree Exploration (ETE), a python programming toolkit that assists in the automated manipulation, analysis and visualization of hierarchical trees. ETE libraries provide a broad set of tree handling options as well as specific methods to analyze phylogenetic and clustering trees. Among other features, ETE allows for the independent analysis of tree partitions, has support for the extended newick format, provides an integrated node annotation system and permits to link trees to external data such as multiple sequence alignments or numerical arrays. In addition, ETE implements a number of built-in analytical tools, including phylogeny-based orthology prediction and cluster validation techniques. Finally, ETE's programmable tree drawing engine can be used to automate the graphical rendering of trees with customized node-specific visualizations.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: ETE provides a complete set of methods to manipulate tree data structures that extends current functionality in other bioinformatic toolkits of a more general purpose.

	abstract = {The biodiversity of microbial communities has important implications for the stability and functioning of ecosystem processes. Yet, very little is known about the environmental factors that define the microbial niche and how this influences the composition and activity of microbial communities. In this study, we derived niche parameters from physiological response curves that quantified microbial respiration for a diverse collection of soil bacteria and fungi along a soil moisture gradient. On average, soil microorganisms had relatively dry optima (0.3 MPa) and were capable of respiring under low water potentials (-2.0 MPa). Within their limits of activity, microorganisms exhibited a wide range of responses, suggesting that some taxa may be able to coexist by partitioning the moisture niche axis. For example, we identified dry-adapted generalists that tolerated a broad range of water potentials, along with wet-adapted specialists with metabolism restricted to less-negative water potentials. These contrasting ecological strategies had a phylogenetic signal at a coarse taxonomic level (phylum), suggesting that the moisture niche of soil microorganisms is highly conserved. In addition, variation in microbial responses along the moisture gradient was linked to the distribution of several functional traits. In particular, strains that were capable of producing biofilms had drier moisture optima and wider niche breadths. However, biofilm production appeared to come at a cost that was reflected in a prolonged lag time prior to exponential growth, suggesting that there is a trade-off associated with traits that allow microorganisms to contend with moisture stress. Together, we have identified functional groups of microorganisms that will help predict the structure and functioning of microbial communities under contrasting soil moisture regimes.},

The role of microbial processes in the mobilization of trace elements from wastewater sludge is poorly defined. Our objectives were to determine trace element mobilization from sludge subjected to treatments representing microbial acidification, direct chemical acidification and no acidification, and to determine the readsorption potential of mobilized elements using calcareous sand. Triplicate columns (10-cm diameter) for incubation and leaching of sludge had a top layer of digested dewatered sludge (either untreated, acidified with H2SO4, or limed with CaCO 3; all mixed with glass beads to prevent ponding) and a lower glass bead support bed. Glass beads in the sludge layer, support layer or both were replaced by calcareous sand in four treatments used for testing the readsorption potential of mobilized elements. Eight sequential 8-day incubation and leaching cycles were operated, each consisting of 7.6d of incubation at 28??C followed by 8h of leaching with synthetic acid rain applied at 0.25cm/h. Leachates were analyzed for trace elements, nitrate and pH, and sludge layer microbial respiration was measured. The largest trace element, nitrate and S losses occurred in treatments with the greatest pH depression and greatest microbial respiration rates. Cumulative leaching losses from both microbial acidification and direct acidification treatments were {\textgreater}90{\%} of Zn and 64-80{\%} of Cu and Ni. Preventing acidification with sludge layer lime or sand restricted leaching for all trace elements except Mo. Results suggested that the primary microbial role in the rapid leaching of trace elements was acidification, with results from direct acidification being nearly identical to microbial acidification. Microbial activity in the presence of materials that prevented acidification mobilized far lower concentrations of trace elements, with the exception of Mo. Trace elements mobilized by acidification were readsorbed by calcareous sand when present. ?? 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {One important problem in microbiome analysis is to identify the bacterial taxa that are associated with a response, where the microbiome data are summarized as the composition of the bacterial taxa at different taxonomic levels. This paper considers regression analysis with such compositional data as covariates. In order to satisfy the subcompositional coherence of the results, linear models with a set of linear constraints on the regression coefficients are introduced. Such models allow regression analysis for subcompositions and include the log-contrast model for compositional covariates as a special case. A penalized estimation procedure for estimating the regression coefficients and for selecting variables under the linear constraints is developed. A method is also proposed to obtain de-biased estimates of the regression coefficients that are asymptotically unbiased and have a joint asymptotic multivariate normal distribution. This provides valid confidence intervals of the regression coefficients and can be used to obtain the {\$}p{\$}-values. Simulation results show the validity of the confidence intervals and smaller variances of the de-biased estimates when the linear constraints are imposed. The proposed methods are applied to a gut microbiome data set and identify four bacterial genera that are associated with the body mass index after adjusting for the total fat and caloric intakes.},

	abstract = {N limitation to primary production and other ecosystem processes is widespread. To understand the causes and distribution of N limitation, we must understand the controls of biological N fixation. The physiology of this process is reasonably well characterized, but our understanding of ecological controls is sparse, except in a few cultivated ecosystems. We review information on the ecological controls of N fixation in free-living cyanobacteria, vascular plant symbioses, and heterotrophic bacteria, with a view toward developing improved conceptual and simulation models of ecological controls of biological N fixation. A model (Howarth et al. 1999) of cyanobacterial fixation in lakes (where N fixation generally increases substantially when N:P ratios are low) versus estuaries (where planktonic N fixation is rare regardless of N:P ratios) concludes that an interaction of trace-element limitation and zooplankton grazing could constrain cyanobacteria in estuaries and so sustain N limitation. Similarly. a model of symbiotic N fixation on land (Vitousek {\&} Field 1999) suggests that shade intolerance, P limitation, and grazing on N-rich plant tissues could suppress symbiotic N fixers in late-successional forest ecosystems. This congruence of results raises the question – why do late-successional tropical forests often contain many potentially N-fixing canopy legumes, while N fixers are absent from most late-successional temperate and boreal forests? We suggest that relatively high N availability in lowland tropical forests permits legumes to maintain an N-demanding lifestyle (McKey 1994) without always being required to pay the costs of fixing N. Overall, both the few simulation models and the more-numerous conceptual models of ecological controls of biological N fixation suggest that there are substantial common features across N-fixing organisms and ecosystems. Despite the many groups of organisms capable 2 of fixing N, and the very different ecosystems in which the process is important, we suggest that these common controls provide a foundation for the development of regional and global models that incorporate ecological controls of biological N fixation.},

	abstract = {Background: Data from 16S amplicon sequencing present challenges to ecological and statistical interpretation. In particular, library sizes often vary over several ranges of magnitude, and the data contains many zeroes. Also, since researchers sample a small fraction of the ecosystem, the observed sequences are relative abundances and therefore the data is compositional. Here we evaluate methods developed in the literature to address these three challenges in the context of normalization and ordination analysis, which is commonly used to visualize overall differences in bacterial composition between sample groups, and differential abundance analysis, which tests for significant differences in the abundances of microbes between sample groups. Results. Effects of normalization on ordination: Most normalization methods successfully cluster samples according to biological origin when many microbes differ between the groups. For datasets in which clusters are subtle and/or sequence depth varies greatly between samples, or for metrics in which rare microbes play an important role, rarefying outperforms other techniques. For abundance-based metrics, rarefying as well as alternatives like DESeq and metagenomeSeq's cumulative sum scaling (CSS), seem to correctly cluster samples according to biological origin. With these normalization alternatives, clustering by sequence depth as a confounding variable must be checked for, especially for low library sizes. Effects of differential abundance testing model choice: We build on previous work to evaluate each statistical method using rarefied as well as unrarefied data. When the mean library sizes in the differential abundance groups differ by more than 2-3x, or the library sizes differ in distribution, our simulation studies reveal that each statistical method improved in its false positive rate when samples were rarefied. However, when the difference in library size mean is less than 2-3x, and the library sizes are similarly distributed, rarefying results in a loss of power for all methods. In this case, DESeq2 has the highest power to compare groups, especially for less than 20 samples per group. MetagenomeSeq's fitZIG is a faster alternative to DESeq2, although it does worse for smaller sample sizes ({\textless}50 samples per group) and tends to have a higher false positives rate. For larger sample sizes ({\textgreater}50 samples), rarefying paired with a non-parametric test, such as the Mann-Whitney test, can also yield equally high sensitivity. Based on these results, we recommend a stepwise procedure in which sample groups are first tested for significant differences in library size. If there is a significant difference, we recommend rarefying with a non-parametric test. Otherwise, DESeq2 and/or fitZIG offer increased sensitivity, especially for rare OTUs and small sample numbers. Conclusions. These findings help guide which technique to use depending on the data characteristics of a given study.},

	abstract = {Co-occurrence patterns are used in ecology to explore interactions between organisms and environmental effects on coexistence within biological communities. Analysis of co-occurrence patterns among microbial communities has ranged from simple pairwise comparisons between all community members to direct hypothesis testing between focal species. However, co-occurrence patterns are rarely studied across multiple ecosystems or multiple scales of biological organization within the same study. Here we outline an approach to produce co-occurrence analyses that are focused at three different scales: co-occurrence patterns between ecosystems at the community scale, modules of co-occurring microorganisms within communities, and co-occurring pairs within modules that are nested within microbial communities. To demonstrate our co-occurrence analysis approach, we gathered publicly available 16S rRNA amplicon datasets to compare and contrast microbial co-occurrence at different taxonomic levels across different ecosystems. We found differences in community composition and co-occurrence that reflect environmental filtering at the community scale and consistent pairwise occurrences that may be used to infer ecological traits about poorly understood microbial taxa. However, we also found that conclusions derived from applying network statistics to microbial relationships can vary depending on the taxonomic level chosen and criteria used to build co-occurrence networks. We present our statistical analysis and code for public use in analysis of co-occurrence patterns across microbial communities.},

	abstract = {Modern microbial mats can provide key insights into early Earth ecosystems, and Shark Bay, Australia, holds one of the best examples of these systems. Identifying the spatial distribution of microorganisms with mat depth facilitates a greater understanding of specific niches and potentially novel microbial interactions. High throughput sequencing coupled with elemental analyses and biogeochemical measurements of two distinct mat types (smooth and pustular) at a millimeter scale were undertaken in the present study. A total of 8,263,982 16S rRNA gene sequences were obtained, which were affiliated to 58 bacterial and candidate phyla. The surface of both mats were dominated by Cyanobacteria, accompanied with known or putative members of Alphaproteobacteria and Bacteroidetes. The deeper anoxic layers of smooth mats were dominated by Chloroflexi, while Alphaproteobacteria dominated the lower layers of pustular mats. In situ microelectrode measurements revealed smooth mats have a steeper profile of O2 and H2S concentrations, as well as higher oxygen production, consumption, and sulfate reduction rates. Specific elements (Mo, Mg, Mn, Fe, V, P) could be correlated with specific mat types and putative phylogenetic groups. Models are proposed for these systems suggesting putative surface anoxic niches, differential nitrogen fixing niches, and those coupled with methane metabolism.},
